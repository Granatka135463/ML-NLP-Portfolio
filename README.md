* This repository is from my lab work

* Lab1.ipynb - Lab4.ipynb and Lab3-2.ipynb - These files are labs from "Fundamentals of Smart Technologies and Systems". Here is a step-by-step implementation of CRISP-DM

* Lab1-CI.ipynb - Lab4-CI.ipynb - These files are labs from "Computational intelligence technologies and methods".
* Lab1_CI.ipynb - here we move from regression to classification
* Lab2-CI.ipynb - apply clustering
* Lab3-CI.ipynb - compare text lines
* Lab4-CI.ipynb - work with a single-layer perceptron
